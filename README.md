# codebook
A web-based interface to coding environments for any programming languages.

## Introduction

**Codebook** is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) + [react](https://react.dev/) based web application to provide a coding environment, similar to [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for any programming language, if it has a CLI for its SDK.

## Getting started

To start the application, run this command:

```sh
npm start 
```

However, kindly ensure `./app/build` directory exists. If missing, run this command:

```sh
npm run app-build
```

To start the application in **development** mode, run this command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
